# Lessons from Scaling Data Infrastructure

Building reliable data infrastructure at scale requires more than just good engineeringâ€”it requires thoughtful contracts, clear SLAs, and relentless cost control.

## The Challenge

When I joined Opendoor in 2018, our data infrastructure was growing rapidly but inconsistently. We had multiple teams building their own data pipelines, leading to:

- **Inconsistent reliability**: Some pipelines had 99%+ uptime, others failed weekly
- **Unpredictable costs**: Infrastructure costs were growing 40% quarter-over-quarter
- **Developer friction**: Teams spent more time debugging data issues than building features

## The Solution

We implemented a three-pronged approach:

### 1. Standardized Data Contracts

Every data service now requires:

- Explicit schema definitions
- Versioned APIs with backward compatibility
- Clear ownership and SLAs

### 2. Reliability Engineering

- **Circuit breakers** for downstream dependencies
- **Retry logic** with exponential backoff
- **Monitoring** at every layer of the stack

### 3. Cost Control

- **Resource quotas** per team
- **Cost alerts** when spending exceeds thresholds
- **Regular optimization** sprints

## Results

After 18 months of implementation:

- **99.9%+ uptime** on critical data paths
- **30% reduction** in infrastructure costs
- **10+ teams** now building on our data platform

## Key Takeaways

1. **Contracts matter more than code**: Clear interfaces prevent integration issues
2. **Monitor everything**: You can't optimize what you can't measure
3. **Cost control is a feature**: Teams appreciate predictable spending

The most important lesson? **Reliability is a product feature, not just an engineering concern.** When data services are reliable, teams can move faster and build better products.
